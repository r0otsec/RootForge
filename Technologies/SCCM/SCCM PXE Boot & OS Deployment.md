PXE boot is commonly used in SCCM for **bare-metal deployments**. Clients boot over the network and are handed a boot image that begins the operating system deployment process via Task Sequences.

This process relies on components from both SCCM and Windows Deployment Services (WDS).
## PXE Boot Flow

1. **PXE Request**  
   - Client sends DHCP request with PXE option
   - Distribution Point (with PXE role) responds

2. **Boot Image Delivery**  
   - DP sends:
     - Boot image (`boot.wim`)
     - BCD file (`boot.bcd`)
     - Boot files (`pxeboot.com`, etc.)
   - Files are generated and stored in `C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\<PackageID>\`

3. **WinPE Launches**
   - Client loads WinPE via TFTP
   - Starts SCCM Task Sequence process

4. **Policy Retrieval**
   - Client contacts MP to request deployment policy
   - TS variables and XML delivered

5. **Execution Begins**
   - OSD proceeds per TS instructions
## PXE-Related Directories

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\` | PXE boot image storage |
| `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\OSD\boot\` | Boot image generation |
| `C:\Windows\Temp\PXEBootFiles\` | Temporary PXE file staging |
## Boot Images

Boot images are **WinPE environments** generated by SCCM. They can be customized with:

- Additional drivers
- Prestart scripts
- Custom variables

These are stored as `.wim` files and linked to Task Sequences.
## BCD File

The **Boot Configuration Data (BCD)** defines how WinPE starts. SCCM automatically generates this file alongside the boot image.

Location:

```
C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\<PackageID>\boot.bcd
```
## Security Considerations

- PXE deployments are **unauthenticated by default**
- Rogue clients can request and receive boot images
- NAA credentials may be exposed early in deployment
- Logging and auditing of PXE events is often poor
